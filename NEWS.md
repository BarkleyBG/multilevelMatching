## This is a forked repo 

- [Original version by Shu Yang](https://github.com/shuyang1987/multilevelMatching)


## Planned improvements

- cleanup code w/ DRY principle
- perhaps merge main 3 user-facing functions into 1

# multilevelMatching 0.1.5

- Added stable references to functions with `::`

# multilevelMatching 0.1.4

- Cleaned up package dependencies
- `multilevelGPSStratification()` now sorts by treatment level `W`
- Vignette now illustrates how user can supply propsensity scores via `GPSM="existing"`

# multilevelMatching 0.1.3

- Better sorting of dataset
- Sorting the matrix of imputed potential outcomes

# multilevelMatching 0.1.2
 
- Add matrix of imputed potential outcomes to output

# multilevelMatching 0.1.1

## Breaking changes

- Output has become tidier. See `estimateTau()` for details

## Small improvements

- Implemented some unit tests
- Some checks and bug-avoidances are introduced
- Added `estimateTau()` to unify the main 3 functions (Dont Repeat Yourself principle)
